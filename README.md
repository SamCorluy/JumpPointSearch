# Jump Point Search
A look into the works of the Jump Point Search algorithm
## How it works
This algorithm is an optimization of the A* pathfinding algorithm that works with uniform-cost grids. It works in such a way that it can make jumps over straight lines rather than take small steps. this is done by eliminating nodes based on hunches about the nodes neighbors.
